# This file documents potential features and their current issue for a new data format / extension of the existing tool.
# TODO: Support WebSockets
# TODO: Support variables for a data source
#   Variables allow to make user_supplied.ds.yml generic
#   Like generics one can define variables, that will be filled during execution (e.g. the username is a variable)
#   Allows multiple variation using the same code.
#   Problem: How to limit? Multiple Variations can't have the same limitations, otherwise they would never be called.
#   However that is also problematic, because then it could cause death by thousand needles on the to be invoked data sources
